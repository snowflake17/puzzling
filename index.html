        <p>My name is Robert Neville. I am a survivor living in New York City. I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies. I will be at <!-- Hmmm, --->the South Street Seaport everyday at mid-day <!--- not sure this is right... -->, when the sun is highest in the sky. If you are out there... if anyone is out there... I can provide food, I can provide shelter, I can provide security. If there's anybody out there... anybody... please. You are not alone.</p>
